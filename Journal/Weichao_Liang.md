## Special explain:
### I am in China now, but the rest of my teammates are in America. So sorry about the inconvenience from different time zones, and thanks to my teammates understanding and the professor's patience .


## Sprint1:
### At this moment, my teammates and I were preparing to begin the project. I was assigned to the Backend. We decided to adopt Express as frame. Then selected My SQL as our database. 

## Sprint2:
### This is our mid-term time, my teammates choose to draw the basic UML graph and build the database.

## Sprint3:
### During this period, firstly, I finished a basic signup function. After that my classmates told me I need to check if the username and email pass from frontend are duplicated, then I finished the checking duplication function, and fixed some mini bugs in the database with Dongmei. Due to the requirement, I also add a function which is “sign up as a realtor”.

## Sprint4:
### Finish the main search in the main page. This search does not need any id verification. Finish the “Buy” page search and “Rent” page, by separate different search_type. Then insert the data pass from Frontend from the filter bar, save the search information as “favorite search” . After inserting the history I also add some api that support to show the favorite search by passing specific user id, and modified the history which means delete the favorite search.

## Sprint5:
### Done the “save as favorite function”. This function aimed to save the favorite house when browsing. Function including checking the favorite list, and deleting content. Agent finder Function is another function I finish during this sprint. First, be able to show all the agents from the table “realtor”, second search by their name or zipcode.

## Sprint6:
### The saving favorite search place aiming to add some filter bar, so I have to update my .js file. During this period, I also checked my work to confirm if there were any minor bugs.
